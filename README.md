## Julia for optimalization
Semestral project for **Julia for Optimization and Learning** class on CTU in Prague

## Goals (to be implemented)
 * gradient descent method
 * nonlinear optimization - Newton-Rhapson, Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquard  
 * linear optimization tools - PCA, Linear regression, Least ssquares
 * Linear programming
   
## Tests or Examples
* use implemented tools to create LQR regulator for simple control problem
